# tramcrazy's forms
This repository contains a selection of hand-built web forms. They use the [Adapt UI](https://github.com/LiveGTech/Adapt-UI) framework for design, built by us at [LiveG](https://liveg.tech).
They are hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and form submissions are saved and managed using [Pageclip](https://pageclip.co).
I'll often use this site for things like surveys and contact forms when I need to.
